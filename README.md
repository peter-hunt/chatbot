# Warnings

**This project is still in development**, so the data structure will change frequently. If you use this project, and your saved files get out of date or just from strange bugs, your files can corrupt.

If your data folder corrupts, delete the chatbot folder under the `~/data` folder to erase it.

If your saved files go corrupt, then it's probably not going to be resolved.
